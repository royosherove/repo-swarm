[![▶ Watch](https://img.youtube.com/vi/rOMf9xvpgtc/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOMf9xvpgtc)

RepoSwarm is an AI powered multi-repo architecture discovery platform that generates its output in a specialized output repository that you can use for agent context.

see example results repo at  [repo-swarm-sample-results-hub](https://github.com/royosherove/repo-swarm-sample-results-hub). 

## Credits
RepoSwarm was born out of a hackathon we ran at Verbit, in which our team, comprised of [Moshe](https://github.com/mosher), [Idan](https://github.com/Idandos) and [Roy](https://github.com/royosherove) created this project together. 

## What's This For?

RepoSwarm is an intelligent agentic-like engine that:

- 🔍 Analyzes GitHub repositories using Claude Code SDK
- 📝 Generates standardized `.arch.md` architecture files  
- 🔄 Runs daily via Temporal workflows on repos with new commits
- 💾 Caches results to avoid redundant analysis
- Writes the results into a results repository that you configure

## How It Works

RepoSwarm runs as a Temporal workflow that automatically processes repositories and feeds  a configured targer repository.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Claude API key

### Installation

**Install mise** (tool version manager):

```bash
# macOS
brew install mise

# Linux/WSL
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

**🚀 Run the setup wizard** (recommended):

```bash
# Interactive setup wizard - sets up everything automatically
mise get-started
```

This wizard will:
- ✅ Create your `.env.local` file
- ✅ Configure your Claude API key
- ✅ Set up GitHub integration (optional)
- ✅ Configure Architecture Hub repository
- ✅ Set up git user details

**Manual setup** (alternative):

```bash
# Copy local environment template
cp env.local.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your Claude API key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Install dependencies**:

```bash
mise install
mise run dev-dependencies
```

### Running RepoSwarm

#### Recommended: Full Local Testing

```bash
# Analyze repositories and generate .arch.md files
# Uses file-based storage (no AWS required)
mise investigate-all
```

This command:

- ✅ Loads configuration from `.env.local`
- ✅ Uses file-based storage (no DynamoDB required)
- ✅ Automatically starts Temporal server and worker
- ✅ Analyzes repositories from `src/prompts/repos.json`
- ✅ Stores `.arch.md` files in `temp/` directory

#### Test Single Repository

```bash
# Test a specific repository
mise investigate-one https://github.com/user/repo

# Or use predefined repos
mise investigate-one hello-world
```

## Configuration

### Adding Repositories

Edit `prompts/repos.json` to add repositories for analysis:

```json
{
  "repositories": {
    "my-backend": {
      "url": "https://github.com/org/my-backend",
      "type": "backend",
      "description": "Main API service"
    },
    "my-frontend": {
      "url": "https://github.com/org/my-frontend", 
      "type": "frontend",
      "description": "React web app"
    }
  }
}
```

### Customizing Analysis Prompts

RepoSwarm uses specialized prompts for different repository types:

- 🔧 **Backend**: APIs, databases, services → [prompts/backend/](prompts/backend/)
- 🎨 **Frontend**: Components, routing, state → [prompts/frontend/](prompts/frontend/)
- 📱 **Mobile**: UI, device features, offline → [prompts/mobile/](prompts/mobile/)
- 📚 **Libraries**: API surface, internals → [prompts/libraries/](prompts/libraries/)
- ☁️ **Infrastructure**: Resources, deployments → [prompts/infra-as-code/](prompts/infra-as-code/)
- 🔗 **Shared**: Security, auth, monitoring → [prompts/shared/](prompts/shared/)

Each type has a `prompts.json` that defines which analysis steps to run.

## Mise Task Organization

### Getting Started with Development

1. **Explore the codebase**: Start with `src/investigator/core/` to understand the analysis engine
2. **Check existing prompts**: Look at `prompts/shared/` for examples of analysis prompts
3. **Run tests**: Use `mise test-all` to ensure everything works
4. **Try investigations**: Use `mise investigate-one hello-world` to see the system in action

### Need Help?

## Production Deployment

For production deployments, you need to deploy Temporal workers that can run on company servers or your local machine. The worker connects to a Temporal server (either locally or remotely) and processes workflow tasks.

### Temporal Worker Deployment

**Key Concepts:**
- **Worker**: A process that hosts workflow and activity implementations
- **Task Queue**: Named queue where workers poll for tasks
- **Temporal Server**: Orchestrates workflow execution and task distribution

**Deployment Options:**
1. **Local Development**: Run workers on your development machine
2. **Company Servers**: Deploy workers to internal infrastructure
3. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deploy to any cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
4. **Containerized**: Run workers in Docker containers or Kubernetes

### Getting Started with Worker Deployment

```bash
# Start Temporal server (local development)
mise dev-server

# Run worker in background
mise dev-worker &

# Trigger workflow via client
mise dev-client

# Monitor workflow status
mise monitor-workflow investigate-repos-workflow
```

### Production Worker Setup

For production environments:

1. **Deploy Worker Image**: Containerize your worker application
2. **Connect to Temporal Server**: Configure connection to your Temporal server
3. **Set Task Queue**: Workers listen on specific task queues
4. **Trigger via API**: Use Temporal client to start workflows

**Example Worker Deployment:**
```bash
# Run worker connecting to remote Temporal server
TEMPORAL_SERVER_URL=your-temporal-server:7233 mise dev-worker
```

### Client Integration

Clients trigger workflows by connecting to the Temporal server and specifying the task queue:

```python
# Example client integration
from temporalio.client import Client

async def trigger_investigation():
    client = await Client.connect("your-temporal-server:7233")
    await client.execute_workflow(
        "investigate_repos_workflow",
        args=["repo-url"],
        id="workflow-id",
        task_queue="investigation-queue"
    )
```

For detailed worker deployment strategies, see the [Temporal Worker Deployments documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/production-deployment/worker-deployments).

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check workflow status
mise monitor-workflow investigate-repos-workflow

# Check Temporal server status
mise monitor-temporal

# View logs (local)
tail -f temp/investigation.log
```

## Advanced: System Architecture

### Workflow Orchestration

The system uses Temporal for reliable workflow orchestration:

1. **Cache Check**: Query DynamoDB to see if repo was already analyzed
2. **Clone**: Clone the repository to temporary storage
3. **Type Detection**: Determine if it's backend, frontend, mobile, etc.
4. **Structure Analysis**: Build a tree of files and directories
5. **Prompt Selection**: Choose appropriate analysis prompts based on repo type
6. **AI Analysis**: Send prompts + code context to Claude for analysis
7. **Result Storage**: Save results to DynamoDB and generate markdown files
8. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files

### DynamoDB Caching

Cache invalidation happens when:

- Repository has new commits
- Branch has changed
- TTL expires (30 days)
- Manual cache clear requested

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Development Issues

**Temporal Server Connection**
```bash
# Check if Temporal server is running
mise monitor-temporal

# Start Temporal server if needed
mise dev-server
```

**Claude API Errors**
- Verify API key: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | head -c 10` (should show first 10 chars)
- Check rate limits in your Anthropic dashboard
- Ensure you're using a valid Claude model name

**Test Failures**
```bash
# Run specific test suites
mise test-units              # Unit tests only
mise test-integration        # Integration tests only
mise test-dynamodb           # DynamoDB tests
```

**Clean Development Environment**
```bash
# Stop all processes
mise kill

# Clean temporary files
mise cleanup-temp

# Reset everything
mise cleanup-temp && mise dev-dependencies
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes and add tests
4. Ensure tests pass: `mise test-all`
5. Submit a pull request

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Set up development environment
mise dev-dependencies
mise dev-server

# Run tests before committing
mise test-all

# Clean up when done
mise kill
mise cleanup-temp
```
